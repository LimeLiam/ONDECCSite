The ONDECC Project itself offers lots of examples of what students can do when they are provided with experiece and opportunity. This website was actually made entirely by two high school students, Liam Borg (CIO and Chief Webmaster) and Isabella Aldegue (Webmaster), using Bootstrap. The headshots of our members were taken by Rayne Landolfi (Discord Manager), and the media was edited by Junwei Tan (Interim President).
