                            <p>The ONDECC Project is a nonprofit organization founded by a group of mostly high schoolers with the initiative to help other high schoolers find the right career paths for them through experience, internship, research, and
                                further education. We offer school clubs, online communication via Discord (a chat app), and events such as mixers, competitions, and festivals. We believe that students who are able to get exposure in career fields before
                                adulthood can enter adulthood happier and with a better financial future. 80% of college students change their majors at least once, which can be expensive and hard to afford. On top of that, the vast majority of high school
                                students have no clue what they want to be later in life. With prior experience, however, students can already have an interest in a certain career path. They can also find new passions and talents.</p>
                            <p>The ONDECC Project itself offers lots of examples of what students can do when they are provided with experiece and opportunity. This website was actually made entirely by two high school students, Liam Borg (CIO and Chief
                                Webmaster) and Isabella ______(Webmaster), using Bootstrap and raw code using the AJAX, jQuery, React.JS, Gatsby.JS, and Django libraries. The headshots of our members were taken by Rayne Landolfi (Discord Manager), and
                                the media was edited by Junwei Tan (Interim President).<br></p>
                            <p class="mb-0"><span>We also believe that the best way to help high schoolers is through high schoolers. Because our target audience and member group are of the same demographic, it can be much easier to keep students happy with their experiences in our group as well as to be in touch with the target generation of our services.</span></p>
